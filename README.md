# <h1>Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹</h1>

## About Me

My name is **Mazen Adel**, and I'm a passionate **Software Testing Engineer**. I thrive on creating high-quality, reliable software through meticulous testing and a keen eye for detail. With a solid foundation in both manual and automated testing, I excel in ensuring that software meets the highest standards of quality. My expertise spans **API testing**, **performance testing**, **mobile testing**, and **automation**, using tools like **Jira**, **Selenium**, **Postman**, and many others.

I believe that testing is not just about finding bugsâ€”it's about delivering a product that users can trust and enjoy. I'm driven by the challenge of identifying and resolving even the most elusive issues, and I strive for excellence in everything I do.

âœ¨ **Creating bugs since 2024**  
Iâ€™m not just about finding bugsâ€”Iâ€™m about **creating them** and watching them evolve into opportunities for growth! Every bug is a chance to dive deep into the code, uncover hidden issues, and improve the overall quality of the product. I approach every testing phase like a treasure hunt, where my goal is to uncover even the most elusive bugs that can impact the end-user experience.

ðŸŽ¯ **Goals:** To master automation testing and become an integral part of a team that drives excellence in software quality.
